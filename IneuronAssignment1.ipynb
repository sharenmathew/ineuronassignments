    "#ASSIGNMENT 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1)In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUE- 'hello',-87.8 , 6\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPRESSION- *,- , / , +\n",
    "\n",
    "2)What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "String - It is a data which is stored in a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable- It is a location to store data in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Describe three different data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Integer -These data types can be zero, positive and negative whole number without the fraction part.The integer type in python is called as str\n",
    "b)String - It is a sequence of charecters which is written inside single or double quotes. The string type in python is called as int\n",
    "c)float - These data types have a fraction or decimal part.The float type in python is called as float\n",
    "\n",
    "4)What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of numerical values variables and operators . An expression always returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)This assignment statements, like spam = 10. \n",
    "What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression-An expression produces a value.10 is the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement- It is an entire line of code that performs an action but never returns a value.spam =10 is the statement\n",
    "\n",
    "6)After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain? bacon = 22 bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon=22\n",
    "\n",
    "7)What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam'  ='spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'*3 = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "variables can start with lowercase letter, so eggs is valid.\n",
    "variables cannot start with digit, so 100 is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9)What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "a)int()\n",
    "b)float()\n",
    "c)str()\n",
    "\n",
    "10)Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it? 'I have eaten'+ 99+ 'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "string and integer concatenation is not possible in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be fixed by putting '99' in quotes 'I have eaten'+ ' 99 '+ 'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
