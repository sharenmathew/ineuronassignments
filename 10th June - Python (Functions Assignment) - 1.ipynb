    "\n",
    "Example: len(),input()\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take parameters or arguments, which are values you supply to the function so it can perform a computation with them. These parameters are placed inside parentheses after the function name.After defining a function, you can call it by writing its name followed by parentheses (). If the function takes parameters or arguments, you pass them inside these parentheses\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "function can have return value or does not need a return statement. if the return statement is used in a function, then the value is stored and this can be used in other parts of your program.A function can have multiple return statements. But when any of them is executed, the function terminates. \n",

    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are small functions defined with the lambda keyword.These are usually not used for complex operations,loop ,if or else statements.Lambda functions are useful for small tasks that are not reused throughout your code.These can take any number of arguments, but can have only one expression. They are not user friendly. This function does not need return statement. The expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called.\n",
